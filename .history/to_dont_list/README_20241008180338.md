# Transformers Collection
A handy app to help a user keep track of their Transformers Toy collection!
The app lists toys with their name and a circle representing their faction (Red for Autobot, purple for Decepticon, grey for other)
Tapping on a toy removes the circle and indicates it's a wishlist item, or that you plan to get it but don't have it.
Use the Floating Action Button to add a new toy, enter in the name, and use the dropdown menu to select the faction. 
Roll out!
